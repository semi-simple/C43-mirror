# WP43S

This project is to develop firmware for a pocket calculator that is a super-set of the legendary HP-42S RPN Scientific.  
We strive to create a serious scientific instrument again like we did with the WP 34S (look here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/wp34s/).

WP 43S is going to come pretty close to the ultimate RPN scientific calculator - at least that's what we will be trying to achieve. That means it will be instant-on, including all the mathematics you can expect in such a package, all the keystroke programming capabilities you need to solve repetitive as well as iterative problems easily, and I/O channels for reliable backup and easy linking to an arbitrary host computer.
