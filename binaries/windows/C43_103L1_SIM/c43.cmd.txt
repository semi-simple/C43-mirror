Procedure to link the C43 simulator to the Windows CALC key on the keyboard:

Create a folder on a easy to access place, i.e. C:\C43
Copy all required simulator files there, whic are at the time of writing:

c43.cmd
c43.cmd.txt (this file)
c43.reg
c43.exe
C43_StandardFont.ttf
dm42l_L1.png
c43_pre.css
buildnote.txt

Edit the c43.cmd file to contain reference to the correct folder, default being c:\C43\c43.exe
Edit the c43.reg file to refer to the correct folder, default being c:\C43
Double click the C43.reg file, and confirm adding to the registry.

Now, Calc should call the batch file c43.cmd, which will start the c43.exe simulator.
